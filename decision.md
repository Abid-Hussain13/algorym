# Architecture Decisions

## Session Status Lifecycle

**Date:** 2026-09-21

### Status Flow
```
scheduled → live → completed
    |          |
    +→ cancelled +→ expired
```

### Transitions
| From | To | Trigger | Implementation |
|------|-----|---------|----------------|
| (new, with scheduled_at) | `scheduled` | Session created | `createSession` service |
| (new, no scheduled_at) | `live` | Session created | `createSession` service |
| `scheduled` | `live` | `scheduled_at` time arrives | **Cron job** (every 60s) |
| `live` | `completed` | Host clicks complete | `completeSession` API |
| `live` | `expired` | `expires_at` time passes | **Cron job** (every 60s) |
| `scheduled` | `cancelled` | Host clicks cancel | `cancelSession` API |

### Implementation Details
- **Backend cron**: `node-cron` runs every 60s, auto-starts scheduled sessions and auto-expires live sessions
- **Frontend polling**: `useSessionStatusPoller` hook polls every 30s, detects status changes, shows toast on any page
- **No WebSocket for status changes**: Polling is sufficient. WebSocket will be added later for real-time collaboration (live room)
- **Cancel button**: Added to EditSessionModal with confirmation dialog

### Rationale
- Cron is simple, reliable, and doesn't require external infrastructure
- 30s polling keeps UI fresh without excessive server load
- Toast notifications on any page via global `DashboardLayout` hook
- User cannot manually expire sessions — only cancel (scheduled) or complete (live)

# Session Detail (Reports) Page — Data Fetching

**Date:** 2026-09-25

## Decision: Single enhanced query over multiple fetches

`GET /api/session/:id` returns everything the detail page needs in **one** query:

```sql
SELECT s.id, s.created_by, s.question_id, s.mode, s.status, s.access_token,
       s.role_context, s.language, s.scheduled_at, s.duration_minutes,
       s.started_at, s.ended_at, s.expires_at, s.created_at,
       sp.display_name AS candidate_name, sp.email AS candidate_email,
       se.rating, se.notes, q.title AS question_title
FROM sessions s
LEFT JOIN session_participants sp ON sp.session_id = s.id AND sp.role = 'guest'
LEFT JOIN session_evaluations se ON se.session_id = s.id AND se.evaluated_participant_id = sp.id
LEFT JOIN questions q ON q.id = s.question_id
WHERE s.created_by = $1 AND s.id = $2
```

Session columns are listed explicitly (not `s.*`) so the API contract is visible in code.

### Report fields
- Show: `scheduled_at`, `created_at`, `duration_minutes`, `started_at`, `ended_at`
- `started_at` / `ended_at` shown — they tell whether the session ran on time
- `expires_at` returned but **not rendered** — it's just `scheduled_at + duration` (internal cron timer), redundant on screen
- Question shown by **title only** — no description on the reports page

### Rationale
- Detail page is a single page → independent caching of sub-resources buys nothing
- One HTTP request instead of 2–3 (session + evaluation + question)
- Notes edits invalidate `['session', sessionId]` → whole page refreshes consistently

### Service separation
- **`getSessionById`** — kept unchanged (`SELECT *`), still used as ownership check by `saveNotes`, `getEvaluation`, `getSessionEvents`, `evaluateUser`
- **`getSessionDetail`** — new, used only by the `GET /api/session/:id` endpoint

### Type
`SessionDetail extends Session` adds `notes` and `question_title`.
`candidate_name` / `candidate_email` / `rating` remain optional on `Session` (LEFT JOIN may be NULL).

### Notes access
- Notes live **only** on the detail page (no column/popup on the sessions table)
- Edit allowed only for `live` / `completed` sessions (backend constraint)
